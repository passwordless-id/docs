Comfort
-------

### Just use your fingerprint...

No more passwords, yay! No more typing, forgetting, resetting, cursing about complexity rules and so on!

### Manage profile in one place

Tired of filling your profile information again and again? Well, you don't have to anymore!
Choose a portrait, fill in your profile and every website can access it (if you permit it to do so).

### Multi-device / Multi-platform

Don't want to pull out your phone for 2FA each time? Well, simply register all your devices here.
Then you can use any of your authorized devices, whether it's a PC, a laptop, a tablet or a phone to sign-in directly and as securely.
Of course, you can also block them if they are stolen or compromised.


### Truly passwordless

We have truly passwordless recovery mechanisms too, relying on having multiple authorized devices if possible.

Moreover, as hackers know, "an authentication service is as secure as its recovery mechanisms".
It would be pointless if the recovery mechanism was based on passwords or questions/responses.
Therefore, it's more secure as well!

Security
--------

### No brute-forcing your password

Passkeys / WebAuthn is based on public key cryptography instead of passwords.
As such, "guessing" or brute-forcing the cryptographic key is practically infeasible. 

### Phishing resistant

No passwords, no phishing. It's as simple as that.

The passkey is kept safe on your device or in your password manager and is never exposed directly.
Instead, it is used to cryptographically sign an everchanging "challenge".
As such, there is no risk of theft and even replay attacks become futile.

### Secure even if hacked

Even in the *hypothetical* worst case scenario of our service being hacked,
an attacker could still not impersonate you because only the public key is stored there.
The private key is kept safe on your device or in your password manager and never exposed directly.

### We have paranoid security

We go to great length to have protection in-depth. For example, even if an attacker manages to access our database, nothing could be read since the content is doubly encrypted.
Likewise, the decryption key is kept in a secret vault.
All primary keys are hashed values, and so on.

### Just inspect our code!

You don't have to take our word for it. We are open source. Dive-in, convince yourself.

Privacy
-------

### No tracking with user IDs

As a counter-example, when you use "Sign in with Google", all websites will receive your global Google user ID.
This makes it possible to track your activity accross all websites, even without third-party cookies, and you cannot do anything about it.

Such a thing is impossible with Passwordless.ID.
All websites will receive distinct anonymized IDs for the same person.
It's like you are a different person for each website you visit.


### No third-parties involved

The data is safely kept here. It is neither shared, nor sold or nor otherwise transmitted to any third-parties.
It goes straight to our database and stays there.

### Fine-grained profile access

You can clearly define what can be accessed from your profile.
Whether it is only the nickname, the e-mail, the portrait... on a per website basis.
It's not a "profile" all-or-nothing unlike some providers.

### Anonymized E-Mails (TODO)

Don't want spam? Well, you could anonymize your e-mail.
That way, you do not have to disclose your real e-mail to the third-party website. 
The e-mails can then be forwarded or straight up blocked, as you wish.

By developers, for developers
-----------------------------

### No need to register

Unlike other providers like Apple, Google, Microsoft and others, you don't need to register anything.
Just use your domain as `client_id` and a `redirect_uri` belonging to your domain. That's it.
No registration, no limits, no fuss.

### It's free forever

It's free! Completely free for everyone, forever and without catch.

It is our conviction that making it publicly available is the best way to make the internet a safer place as a whole.

If you like it and use it, you are very welcome to [sponsor us](https://github.com/sponsors/passwordless-id) though.


### OAuth2 / OpenID compliant

Passwordless.ID is compatible with both OAuth2 and OpenID protocols.
That way, you can use it as a generic OpenID provider for a "Sign in with..." button.

### Detect bots and fake accounts

For websites, it is difficult to distinguish real users from fake ones like bots.
A "reputation" associated to users helps to determine their trustworthiness.
The reputation for example increases with verified informations (e-mail, phone, multi-devices, identity) and behavior (account age, regular activity)
while it decreases upon complaints. The whole in a privacy-preserving way of course.
